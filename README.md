<h1 style="text-align: center">Gastos</h1>
<p style="text-align: center">An app to suite all your expense (finances in general) tracking needs with support for multiple wallets and custom color-coded labels.</p>


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


**Note:**

This is only the frontend part of the entire app, the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/jalaj711/gastos-backend). You will need to install the backend to be able to run this app. The frontend will by default re-route all API requests to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
